			<p class="t5 ff">Memento is a start-up retail establishment that will sell fashionable clothing to men of the Baby Boom generation. We will locate Booming Boutique in downtown Pleasantville, Florida, which is a popular retirement and tourist destination. While our initial goal is to open one boutique, expansion plans include potentially franchising our retail store and/or building a well-recognized brand name. In turn, we would hope to penetrate a sizable portion of the online retail market. The fashion and retail industry tends to be overly youth focused. However, by closely following generational fashion trends as well as our own customers’ purchasing preferences, we will tailor our inventory to meet the specific needs of our clientele. We will solely focus on the our styles, colors and fits to flatter the lady Baby Boomer Meeting the needs of her figure will be our specialty. The total sales reported in the U.S. retail industry in 2007 (including food service and automotive) exceeded $4 trillion. There are roughly 75 million Baby Boomers, half of which are men. In Pleasantville, the current population is just fewer than 40,000. 54 percent of the total population is men who have a median age of 48. The median income is $48,600. We will initially seek customers locally, but will increase our reach as we build our brand and secure our image. Booming Boutique recognizes the importance of marketing. And to that end, we plan to promote our retail business with an ambitious, targeted marketing campaign, which will include a grand opening event, local media coverage, print advertising and a direct-mail campaign. Our goal is to keep our marketing budget to no more than 5% of our gross annual sales, and we will partner with local organizations such as the Chamber of Commerce and Downtown Merchants Association as often as possible. Robin Mathews and Joanna Jensen are co-owners and will co-manage Booming Boutique. Mathews has worked ten years in the retail industry, including four years as the manager of an antique furniture shop. She earned a BA degree in finance from Britannica College in Tampa, Florida. Jensen’s experience lies in the fashion industry. She’s worked with designers, wholesalers and retailers for roughly 20 years. Jensen holds a BA in fashion merchandising from Colliers Fashion Institute in Miami, Florida.</p>
